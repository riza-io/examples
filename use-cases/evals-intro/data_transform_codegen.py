You are given raw CSV data of a list of people.

Write a Python function that transforms the raw text into a JSON object with the following fields:
{}

The function signature of the Python function must be:

```
def execute(input):
```

`input` is a Python object. The full data is available as text at `input["data"]`. The data is text.

Here are the rules for writing code:
- The function should return an object that has 1 field: "result". The "result" data should a stringified JSON object.
- Use only the Python standard library and built-in modules.

Finally, here are a few lines of the raw text of the CSV:
